# A Developers Guide to AI - Workshop

![Learning Path](https://img.shields.io/badge/Learning%20Path-AIML-fe5e00?logo=microsoft)

## Welcome!

In this workshop you will go through various levels of AI tasks using the Microsoft Azure platform - from leveraging pre-built AI services via REST APIs to writing code to leverage the Azure Machine Learning Service and SDK

Below is a title and abstract for each part of the workshop provided. Click on the first title to get going.

### [Making Sense of your Unstructured Data with AI](aiml10/workshop-instructions.md)

#### Session Code: AIML10

In this workshop you will make sense of unstructured data using AI services. You are a Tailwind Traders developer and Tailwind Traders has a lot of legacy data that they’d like to leverage in their apps. This data is from various sources, both structured and unstructured, and includes images, forms, pdf files etc. 
You'll learn how you can build an end-to-end architecture, with Azure Cognitive Search at its heart, to make sense of this unstructured data within the business. You’ll be introduced to AI concepts, like the ingest-enrich-explore pattern, skillsets, cognitive skills, natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.


### [Using Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges](aiml20/workshop-instructions.md)

#### Session Code: AIML20

As a data-driven company, Tailwind Traders understands the importance of using Artificial Intelligence to improve business processes and delight customers. Before investing in an AI team, their existing developers were able to demonstrate some quick wins using pre-built AI technologies. In this workshop, we will show how you can use Azure Cognitive Services to extract insights from retail data and go into the neural networks behind computer vision. You’ll learn how it works and how to augment the pre-built AI with your own images for custom image recognition applications.

### [Start Building Machine Learning Models Faster than You Think](aiml30/workshop-instructions.md)

#### Session Code: AIML30

Tailwind Traders uses custom machine learning models to fix their inventory issues – without changing their Software Development Life Cycle! How? Azure Machine Learning designer. In this session, you’ll learn the data science process that Tailwind Traders’ uses and get an introduction to Azure Machine Learning designer. You’ll see how to find, import, and prepare data, select a machine learning algorithm, train and test the model, and deploy a complete model to an API. Get the tips, best practices, and resources you and your development team need to continue your machine learning journey and build your first model.

### [Taking Models to the Next Level with Azure Machine Learning Best Practices](aiml40/workshop-instructions.md)

#### Session Code: AIML40

Tailwind Traders’ data science team uses natural language processing (NLP), and recently discovered how to fine-tune and build a baseline model with Automated ML. 

In this session, you’ll learn what Automated ML is and why it’s so powerful, then dive into how to improve upon baseline models, using examples from the NLP best practices repository. We’ll highlight Azure Machine Learning key features and how you can apply them to your organization, including low priority compute instances, distributed training with auto scale, hyperparameter optimization, collaboration, logging, and deployment.
