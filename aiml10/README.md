# AIML10: Making Sense of your Unstructured Data with AI

## Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders has a lot of legacy data that theyâ€™d like their developers to leverage in their apps â€“ from various sources, both structured and unstructured, and including images, forms, pdf files, and several others. In this session, you'll learn how the team used Cognitive Search to make sense of this data in a short amount of time and with amazing success. We'll discuss tons of AI concepts, like the ingest-enrich-explore pattern, skillsets, cognitive skills, natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.

# Overview
In this solution we develop a process whereby we take a set of unstructured pdf invoices and generate structured tabular output using Azure Cognitive Search with a customized Form Recognizer Skill. 

When creating this solution there are a few Azure resources ([free trial here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/?WT.mc_id=msignitethetour2019-github-aiml10) if you need it) that are created. The following tables list each resource, its purpose, and any special instructions needed to implement the solution fully (I use the names as presented during the talk but they will need to be renamed for your particular solution):

| Name                       | Type                            | Purpose                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **ttcognitivesearch**     | Resource Group                  | Groups services together   |
| **ttinvoicestorage**      | Storage Account                 | Used to store invoices     |
| **ttinvoicesearch**       | Search Service                  | Featured service           |
| **ttinvoiceintelligence** | Cognitive Services (All-In-One) | Used in the search service |
| **ttinvoicereader**       | Form Recognizer Service         | This service will eventually end up in the All-In-One sevice. For right now it is in limited-access preview. To get access to the preview, fill out and submit the [Form Recognizer access request](https://aka.ms/FormRecognizerRequestAccess) form.  |
| **readerskillstorage**   | Storage Account              | Storage used for Azure Function |
| **readerskill**          | Function App                 | Cognitive Skill App |
| **readerskill**          | App Insights                   | Adds insights to Function App |
| **EastUS2LinuxDynamicPlan** | App Service Plan                   | Consumption based plan for running Function App |
