# **Workshop:** Making Sense of your Unstructured Data with AI

## Workshop Abstract

In this workshop you will make sense of unstructured data using AI services. You are a Tailwind Traders developer and Tailwind Traders has a lot of legacy data that they’d like to leverage in their apps. This data is from various sources, both structured and unstructured, and includes images, forms, pdf files etc. 
You'll learn how you can build an end-to-end architecture, with Azure Cognitive Search at its heart, to make sense of this unstructured data within the business. You’ll be introduced to AI concepts, like the ingest-enrich-explore pattern, skillsets, cognitive skills, natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.
