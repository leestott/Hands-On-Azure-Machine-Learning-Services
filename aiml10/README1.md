# AIML10: Making Sense of your Unstructured Data with AI

## Train-the-Trainer Guide

### Session Abstract

Tailwind Traders has a lot of legacy data that theyâ€™d like their developers to leverage in their apps â€“ from various sources, both structured and unstructured, and including images, forms, pdf files, and several others. In this session, you'll learn how the team used Cognitive Search to make sense of this data in a short amount of time and with amazing success. We'll discuss tons of AI concepts, like the ingest-enrich-explore pattern, skillsets, cognitive skills, natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond.
